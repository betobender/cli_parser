# CLI Parser
A simple command line interface parser. A bunch of times I needed something like this during my personal projects and in the end, I come to this header only command line parser.
### Examples on how to use
* Please, refer to samples/hello_world.cpp for a real example.
### Compatibility
* Built under VS2015 (Update 3) and gcc (5.4.0)
